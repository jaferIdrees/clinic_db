# Clinic Database

> This database includes five tables for patients, invoices, medical_histories, invoice_items, and treatments.

> To implement the many-to-many relationship between medical_histories and treatments we added an extra table called medical_histories_treatment

## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
